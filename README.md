# Universal Data Acquisition Pipeline Skill

Stop writing brittle scrapers. Design the data pipeline.

This Codex skill turns messy data acquisition requests into due-diligence reports, source classifications, and production-grade scraping/API pipeline plans. It is aggressive about discovering APIs, XHR endpoints, page-data routes, sitemaps, catalogs, embedded JSON, browser network routes, and rendered DOM fallback paths because structured routes are usually faster, cleaner, and less brittle than HTML scraping.

It is balanced about feasibility. If a source works, it says so. If the data is public, authenticated, licensed, partial, rate-limited, risky, blocked, or not worth collecting, it says that too.

The skill is also portable to Claude-style skill folders because the core artifact is a standard `SKILL.md` plus markdown references.

The core question is not "can we scrape this page?"

The core question is:

```text
What is the right data acquisition path, and can it become a reliable pipeline?
```

## What It Does

- Converts vague data asks into a concrete `DatasetSpec`
- Classifies source access: public, owned session, provided credentials, licensed API, partner API, internal system, or reject
- Designs the actual dataset need before collection: decision, grain, fields, freshness, history, coverage, join keys, and exclusions
- Finds public APIs and storefront/page-data endpoints
- Derives endpoint templates, query params, headers, and pagination behavior
- Probes limits with tiny requests before broad collection
- Supports authorized owned-session Playwright pipelines without publishing them as public results
- Adds production pipeline design: checkpoints, dedupe, raw/staged/normalized layers, quality gates, run reports, and recovery
- Uses Playwright/rendered DOM as a bounded last resort when no public structured route works
- Scores technical and responsible collection feasibility with Green/Yellow/Red status
- Produces a data acquisition memo: fastest route, cheapest robust route, highest-coverage route, trapdoors, and stop conditions
- Designs reusable pipeline plans with validation and approval gates
- Produces consistent outputs: `SourcePlan`, `EndpointPlan`, `HeaderProfile`, `ProbeResults`, `FeasibilityScorecard`, `DataAcquisitionMemo`, `FeasibilityReport`, `PipelinePlan`, `SampleRows`, and `ApprovalGate`

## What It Refuses

This skill prefers public and structured data, but it can also design authenticated or licensed pipelines when the user has authorization.

It does not do auth bypass, paywall bypass, CAPTCHA solving, unauthorized private account access, credential theft, fingerprint evasion, exploit generation, or rate-limit bypass.

Cookies/session state are allowed only for explicit user-owned or authorized workflows. Those outputs must be labeled non-public and must never be published as public pipeline evidence.

The skill can detect limits and design within them using backoff, caching, checkpointing, sampling, dedupe, and explicit approval gates.

## Source Access Classes

| Class | Use Case | Publish As Public Result |
|---|---|---|
| Public | Unauthenticated APIs, pages, feeds, sitemaps, files | yes |
| Owned Session | User's own logged-in account/session | no |
| Provided Credentials | User-controlled portal credentials | no |
| Licensed API | API key or data license | depends on license |
| Partner API | Integration or partner access | depends on terms |
| Internal System | User's own app/admin/database | no |
| Restricted/Reject | Requires bypass, evasion, or unauthorized access | no |

## The Scorecard

Every serious feasibility report should make the decision obvious:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Coverage | How much of the requested dataset appears reachable |
| Stability | How brittle the route looks |
| Pagination depth | Whether public pagination reaches the target scale |
| Refreshability | Whether the pipeline can run repeatedly |
| Data quality | Whether fields are complete and normalized enough |
| Engineering cost | S, M, L, or XL |
| Legal/ToS risk | low, medium, or high |
| Recommended path | official API, public XAPI, embedded JSON, sitemap plus detail, HTML, rendered DOM, or reject |
| Traffic light | Green, Yellow, or Red |

Green means build the pipeline. Yellow means sample, narrow, or find another route. Red means stop.

## Modes

Use the router skill or call a focused child skill directly:

| Skill | Use It When |
|---|---|
| `universal-data-acquisition-pipeline` | Router for the whole acquisition workflow |
| `data-acquisition-core` | Shared contracts, source access, compliance, output schemas |
| `data-acquisition-design` | You know the business goal but not the exact data needed |
| `data-acquisition-feasibility` | You named a dataset and need to know whether it is collectible |
| `data-acquisition-discovery` | You want APIs, XHR/fetch routes, feeds, sitemaps, or embedded JSON |
| `data-acquisition-browser` | You need Playwright, rendered DOM, network capture, or owned-session browser probes |
| `data-acquisition-pipeline` | Sources are known and you want a production-grade pipeline |
| `data-acquisition-publish` | You want to publish real probe-backed results |

Default ladder:

```text
Dataset Design -> Feasibility -> Endpoint Discovery -> Pagination/Limits -> Pipeline Design -> Sample Validation -> Execution
```

## 15-Second Demo

Prompt:

```text
Use $universal-data-acquisition-pipeline to find all public product metadata for Macy's.
Prefer public APIs or page-data endpoints over HTML scraping. Stop at feasibility first.
```

What the skill should discover:

```text
category sitemap -> public category discover XAPI -> product IDs -> product detail XAPI
```

The useful result is not "here is a scraper." The useful result is:

- the endpoint templates
- the params and headers that matter
- the page and category limits
- the feasibility scorecard
- the data acquisition memo
- sample rows
- a feasibility score
- a reusable pipeline plan
- an approval gate before a full run

## Case Study Snapshot

| Target | Best Source Found | Pagination/Coverage Signal | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Macy's product metadata | Category sitemap -> public category XAPI -> product detail XAPI | Category grids and product IDs are publicly discoverable; dedupe needed across categories | Green |
| Wattpad followers/following | Public user graph API | Followers on popular accounts appear publicly capped near a deep offset; following behaves differently | Yellow |
| StreetEasy listings | Public search-page JSON-LD plus sitemap indexes | Child listing sitemap files returned 403; robots disallows key detail/API paths | Yellow |

## Public API Pattern Library

The skill teaches Codex to recognize common public data routes before falling back to HTML:

- Next.js and Nuxt page data
- GraphQL and persisted queries
- Algolia indices
- Shopify product/catalog JSON
- Salesforce Commerce Cloud APIs
- Storefront XAPI and BFF routes
- sitemap-to-detail enrichment
- JSON-LD and hydration state
- mobile API mirrors
- search, autocomplete, feed, and listing endpoints

## Playwright Fallback

Playwright is allowed, but it is not the first move.

Use it only when public APIs, feeds, sitemaps, embedded JSON, and static HTML are unavailable or incomplete. A Playwright probe should stay tiny, inspect network traffic for public structured routes, capture evidence, and fall back to DOM extraction only when needed.

No CAPTCHA solving, stealth plugins, fingerprint evasion, or rate-limit bypass.

Optional setup:

```powershell
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Run a tiny public-page probe:

```powershell
npm run probe:playwright -- "https://example.com/public-page" "outputs/example-playwright-probe.json"
```

The helper writes a JSON report and screenshot, including network requests, structured JSON/API-looking responses, JSON-LD snippets, candidate links, console messages, and probe bounds.

Authorized owned-session probe:

```powershell
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_STORAGE_STATE = "auth\storage-state.json"
npm run probe:playwright -- "https://example.com/account/export" "outputs/owned-session-probe.json"
```

The storage state file is gitignored. Do not publish owned-session outputs as public case studies.

## Install

## Real Results

- [Macy's product metadata](case-studies/macys.md): category sitemap to public XAPI, with full catalog-check notes.
- [Wattpad followers/following](case-studies/wattpad.md): public endpoint discovery with pagination caps and responsible feasibility scoring.
- [Greenhouse and Lever public job boards](case-studies/greenhouse-lever-jobs.md): ATS public APIs, provider-specific pagination, and hiring-signal pipeline design.
- [StreetEasy public real estate listings](case-studies/streeteasy.md): JSON-LD and sitemap discovery with a clear Yellow boundary around 403s and disallowed routes.

Only publish case studies after using the skill on a real target and recording probe-backed evidence. Keep hypothetical examples in `PROMPTS.md` or `skills/data-acquisition-core/references/examples.md`, not in `case-studies/`.

The router `SKILL.md` stays short so Codex can trigger cheaply. Shared contracts live in `skills/data-acquisition-core/`; focused child skills reference that core instead of duplicating it.

## The Core Idea

Most public websites already fetch structured data for normal users.

The job is to classify access, find the best data path, prove it works, understand its limits, decide whether the collection is worth doing, and only then build the pipeline.

One-off HTML scraping first is usually the slow path.
